# üéØ Real-Time Gender and Age Detection Using OpenCV

This project performs real-time **gender and age detection** using a webcam feed with OpenCV's deep learning module (`cv2.dnn`). It uses pre-trained models to detect faces and then predict the gender and age of each detected face.

---

## üì∏ How It Works

- Uses a webcam to capture video in real-time.
- Detects faces using a pre-trained OpenCV DNN face detector.
- For each detected face, predicts:
  - **Gender** (Male / Female)
  - **Age group** (e.g. 15‚Äì20, 25‚Äì30, etc.)
- Displays predictions on screen along with a bounding box.

## üß† Pre-trained Models Used

- **Face Detection**: `opencv_face_detector.pbtxt`, `opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb`
- **Age Detection**: `age_deploy.prototxt`, `age_net.caffemodel`
- **Gender Detection**: `gender_deploy.prototxt`, `gender_net.caffemodel`

You can download these models from [this repo by spmallick](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/tree/master/AgeGender).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
    ```bash git clone https://github.com/monu754/Age-and-Gender-Detector.git```


### 2. Install Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3 and OpenCV installed.

```bash pip install opencv-python```


### 3. Run the Script
```bash python detect.py```


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
1. Your webcam must be working correctly for this project to function.

2. Ensure your face is clearly visible and well-lit in the webcam feed ‚Äî blurry or poorly-lit images will cause the model to miss detections.

3. The face detector will not detect faces at extreme angles or occluded by objects like hands or masks.

4. To exit the program, use Ctrl + C in the terminal.
